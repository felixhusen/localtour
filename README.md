# Toursy (localtour)

This is an app created based on the project specifications for the subject CSCI334 System Design at The University of Wollongong. The software is built with Aspnetboilerplate Template with .NET Core and angular.

# Project Specification

The sharing economy (also known as the peer-to-peer or collaborative economy) has attracted increasing popularity in recent years. Platforms such as Uber (https://www.uber.com) and Airbnb (https://www.airbnb.com.au/) are being used by millions of people around the world.

In this project, you are asked to design and develop an Uber-like software system which enables people to share their local knowledge and lifestyles with tourists (in the same way as they do with a visiting friend). The system serves as a platform that connects tourists with local people who are able to provide a local tour guide for a given period of time.

# Key Requirements

The system should support at least the following key aspects:

- Manage different types of users, user profiles, and their reviews/ratings.
- Manage a wide range of local tours (e.g. enable providers to create new tours, edit existing tours, adjust prices, and other relevant tour managements) and their reviews/ratings.
- Enable tourists to quickly connect with local tour guides (e.g. search for tours, make bookings, send requests, negotiate on price and requirements, etc.)
- Manage transactions between consumers and providers.
- Manage and facilitate dispute resolutions.
- Manage and generate various relevant reports.

# Deployment

We use docker to deploy the application to the web server.

```

# Build container
docker build . -t toursy

# Run container
docker run -p 8000:80 toursy

```
